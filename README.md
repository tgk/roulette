# roulette

This is a small experiment in using ClojureScript for developing a service for
randomly chosing an option from a list. The service is intended to be used by
teachers for making the proces of selecting students to answer a question more
entertaining and engaging.

## Usage

The ClojureScript is compiled using cljsbuild-lein 

    lein cljsbuild once

The service can be accessed at [http://tgk.github.com/roulette](http://tgk.github.com/roulette) or by cloning the repository and opening index.html.
